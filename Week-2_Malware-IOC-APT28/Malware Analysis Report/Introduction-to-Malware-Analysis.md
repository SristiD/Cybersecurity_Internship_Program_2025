# ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Malware Analysis

**Malware analysis** is the process of examining malicious software to understand:

- Its behavior and inner workings
- Origin and infection vectors
- Potential impact on systems

This practice is essential for:

âœ… Mitigating real-time threats  
âœ… Improving defense strategies  
âœ… Extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

There are two primary analysis approaches:

1. **Static Analysis** â€” inspecting malware without executing it
2. **Dynamic Analysis** â€” monitoring its behavior during execution

Security professionals use both techniques to reverse-engineer samples and identify threat characteristics with the help of sandboxes, debuggers, and forensics tools.
